## Difference between CRLF, LF and CR? (EOL)

EOL - End Of Line:
- LF - Linux, Mac > version 9
- CR - Mac <= version 9
- CRLF - Windows

It's about line breaks. CR is Carriage Return, LF is Line Feed. They are just control characters. There are could be bugs in one project when it is developed on different OS. So, it's important to control them.
